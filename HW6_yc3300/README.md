## Unisse Chua helped me with this homework, I followed professor's instruction/skeleton and Unisse's code for this assignment.

## Goal
Work from the skeleton notebook https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW6_fb55/building_nrg_instructions.ipynb with the inline instructions.

## Process
1. I initially downloaded data in a wrong way (the way professor mentioned in class which she will deduct points from), 
so I corrected the code using Unisse's download method. She explained how and why she wrote the code. 
2. I matched my data cleaning table with Unisse's and corrected mine based on hers. She explained hwo she cleaned data based on professor's graph later
3. Unisse reminded me that instead of just dropping NANs, I should covert all the invalid entries into NAN by using pd.to_numeric as suggested in instructions
4. I went back to remove the outliers after the review session, as a part of data cleaning
