## Process:
1. I decided to do 311 complaints across different zip code plot.
2. I initially wanted to include all complaint types but they are much more than what I expected, therefore I locked the complaint type 
   to "traffic"
3. I received help on debugging codes from Rachel and Unisse Chua, but I managed to finish the skeleton individually. 
4. It's not surprised to see that most areas in Manhattan has the most complaints on traffic, but it's unexpected to see that Staten Island 
somehow has a relevant high level of complaints on traffic as well.
