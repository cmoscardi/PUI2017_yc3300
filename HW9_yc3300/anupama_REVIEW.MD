### CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?


### ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but 
you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? 
Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

This plot used yellow and green to show difference in different quartile category. However, for certain groups of people who cannot tell 
green and yellow apart (though I am not sure the level of brightness will be affective), they may have trouble telling what quartile those
areas belong to.

### HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
The plot honestly reproduce the data without emphasizing any point.
