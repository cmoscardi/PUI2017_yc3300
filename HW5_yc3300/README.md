## For this homework 5, Yunkun Wan, Yuwen Chang, Unisse Chua and Rachel Lim helped me with building codes, correcting my mistakes and answering confusions

## Assignment 1:
## Goal:
Generate N samples from a distribution of your choice, but not a Gaussian with a chosen mean μ and standard deviation σ: N(μ, σ) and calculate the mean of each sample (all samples should have the same size n).

Assess the validity of the Z-test: If the samples are drawn from the distribution you are testing the z-values you calculate should follow a N(0,1) distribution (a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 1). Show that the distribution of z -statistics (find the formula in a statistics book or in last week’s slides) that you calculated (one for each sample) is indeed consistent with N(0,1).
## Process:
1. I followed Professor's example from the lecture and write the code based on her example
2. Yukun Wan help me with understanding the question and corrected my code
3. Yuwen Chang explained why for this question our null hypothesis should be the same as our expectation
