#Assignment
##Assignment 1: tracking each vehicle for a line
##Assignment 2: next stop information
##Assignmnet 3: Read CSV files with pandas

#Process:
##Assignment 1:Write a Python script to retrieve and report information about active vehicle for a bus line.
1. For this assignment, I opened bus data (with my APIKEY) using chrome. All the numbers and information were combined and messed up together with no sequences
   at all, rachel lim xin rong helped me find data location by opening data on her computer using firefox.
2. Rachel (Rachel Lim Xin Rong) helped me with writing code for assignment 1, for this question, I followed along what she said. 
3. Unisse Chua helped me with debugging some commands as some commads were recognized as invalid syntax.

##Assignment 2: Write a Python script that displays information on the next stop location of all busses of a given line.
1. Again, I used Rachel's computer to read data location for this assignment, at the same time, Unisse Chua introduced me to jsonformatter.org
   which organize Json data in a clearer format. 
2. I had trouble finding bus stop information, Rachel helped me with that. 
3. Due the similarity between assignment one and two, I copied and pasted some of the code for assignment 1 and added bus stop information as 
   what Rachel told me.
 
##Assignment 3: Work on compute. Choose a dataset within the CUSP data facility (DF) that is available in CSV format. Chose one that has at least 2 numerical value columns.
1. I had trouble finding data in data catalog, Unisse Chua taught me instead of going to data catalog, I can just go to "Urban Profiler" and filter the chart with numbers.
2. This assignment is similar to the class example professor did, I individually opened CSV file uding DFDATA.
3. Unisse Chua helped me with correcting code for narrowing down the columns using df.drop 
4. I individually plotted the figure.
